hey you know we are we've gotten a lot of that incredible feedback on that www.
food network thing and you know we all like to eat a little lighter than saying.
little healthier huh.
I know what you thinking you thinking hey everyone come on that healthy stuff.
tastes like cardboard.
I used to really think like that but tonight what I'd like to do is show you.
a few tricks that I have a just sort of learns and kind of just sort of lighten.
up a few of those classics little healthier versions if you will of the.
classics.
this is that you love but without losing any flavor that's what we're going to.
try to do tonight kind of zero in on that saturated stuff you know.
now speaking about classic flavor.
give it up for our special musical guests Neil Giraldo was in the house.
right meal.
oh yeah and his wife is a really really big foodie so I like to bring her out.
please give it up for Pat Bennett island.
yeah.
ok.

going to have it gonna be.
are you ready many are rocking out with healthy classics tonight right here on.
several I yeah.
ok.
yeah.
are you doing welcome nice to have you see these on the cheap seats are you.
doing mom.
well it's great to have you guys in the house so excited i wish we were like.
doing Italian food is something no but anyhow we're gonna we're gonna kick it.
up a few notches real simple i'm gonna stop with a little bit of a salad.
actually made with the romaine hearts of romaine but before I do that well I mean.
by hearts of romaine well i just took those beautiful little romaine heads.
made these little wedges like this okay little wedges and we got you had set it.
back to hear we got to have some sort of pork fat even though we're tryna we're.
trying to get lighter you know.
so I said to myself self exactly and then all of a sudden this Canadian bacon.
thing came into my head you know that's free lean it's like a fifth of regular.
bacon not that we're counting that much but alright so we're gonna crisp up a.
little bit of Canadian bacon and i diced up very very lean doesn't have a lot of.
fat and we're going to stop with that we've got our domain and I thought we.
need some croutons.
so what I'm going to do is some drizzle some olive oil on a little bit of the.
slice croutons that I slice from a bag get this is like when you want to use.
good olive oil and all right so we got that now for me I like a little garlic.
you can do it.
yeah i mean come on that's helping employers.
you know and I read recipes like this and they say get a clove of garlic and.
rub the crouton do you guys believe that no you know you read those recipes get a.
clove of garlic and why don't you just wave it over like that you know i mean.
hey if you're going to use some garlic come on get some garlic out here and.
like just give them a little garlic like this right spreading like that don't.
apply so I'm gonna garlic up the croutons going to visit with Pat Neal a.
little bit when we come back another not stick around.
yeah.
yeah.
at home I pretty much do all the cooking he did my husband doesn't help does all.
the eating our kitchen at home obviously has all the accoutrements that you would.
need right here on the bus were really limited cooking and here's a challenge.
want to sit down.
you know it's been 25 years and I've been clicking on the bus for at least 20.
of them so i don't know i think i can cook anywhere now i know it is placed.
where you get.
you have two burners on this bus and you know oven examples which is the cooking.
show.
I think that probably the most ambitious things that I mean don't alleged crepes.
here with caramelized sugar so that was that was pretty amazing.
let's go Jack.
the show.
you can be.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
give it up.
yeah.
delighted to have you many thanks wanted to have you guys are close to lovely.
wife Pat Benatar in the house ladies and gentlemen yesterday.
hey 25 years that's a miracle to begin with I take my hat off with that I mean.
that god bless it's a beautiful thing nine times nominated for a grammy.
four-time Grammy award-winning and a new album out go check it out.
alright yes.
hey you at home by about four hundred copies where you kind of neighborhood on.
yes all right now I've got this pasta dish I'm under a lot of pressure here.
right now that's a great cook so I I mind I'm gonna get the salad out of the.
way so I can move on to another healthy alternative my first of all I want to.
make a simple dressing.
i roasted some garlic one of the tips that I toy was going to share with you.
is that you want to get when you doing this type of lower saturated fat lower.
fat cooking you still want to get the flavor so you gotta look for little.
things to punch the flavors roasted garlic being one of them.
okay lemon lemons another thing that comes to mind curry if you like that.
cayenne pepper.
you got to have things that just sort of just pop the flavors now another thing.
that I think is misrepresented which i'm going to use to make this dressing is.
that when you instantly say to people.
we're going to use buttermilk they go you know in buttermilk really is a one.
of those alternative things that you can use because it doesn't have butter in it.
it's really almost like a yogurt so it's kind of really delicious so we got the.
roasted garlic in there are incest different citrus peels zests flavors.
work i'm gonna use a little orange and this is that mayonnaise you can use.
low-fat mayonnaise.
if you want it's all up to you lots of fresh herbs are a good thing you get a.
lot of impact i'm using a lot of possibly and I'm gonna use a lot of.
chives in there and then simply not what i'm going to do i'm ready to put this.
thing together what we're going to do now is we're going to add the buttermilk.
in here and a real real simple dressing little salt some pepper.
like I said you could use cayenne and really kick it up if you want you could.
use crushed pepper all right now what we're going to do put this thing on here.
now if we wanted to multiply this a little bit more you know like if you.
have oil and vinegar it's like a vinaigrette.
but if you add an egg and then you add oil you have an emulsion like mayonnaise.
was so we already got an emotion in there because we used a little bit of.
that low-fat mayonnaise.
yeah didn't see them on the back of the bond alright all you low fat chicken.
stand up.
just kidding all right look on a serious note and putting this together now I got.
my romaine the inner side the outer edges that I just chopped up.
ok gotta season am I don't know where you get your domain where I get mine it.
don't come season's little salt and pepper get our croutons about eight.
minutes for them and here's how we'll simply put this together.
nice platter light salad take the romaine put some on that side and some.
on this side now.
nice light bacon.
little bit of tomatoes really light will use a little olive oil make them even a.
little wider.
she practically flying out of my hand right now and then we'll just use a.
little bit of those light tomatoes like this and then we'll take the croutons.
put a few of those stacks over here all right now we can either do two things we.
could dress the greens or we could just use a little olive oil toss them up.
then the salad dressing.
so we'll just go a little that way we'll go a little this way we'll go a little.
that way that way and this is so light it's unbelievable.
there you have it ok folks little light.
I know.
this surprise no Parmesan cheese.
hey its light gonna put some of these like croutons in here for texture.
all right now we were talking about how we love pasta so much so while there's a.
nice pasta that there's kind of big strips like this called papa del papa.
del noodles but if you go in light and you want to stay light with the the.
pasta dish thing what you can do is use zucchini is really a fantastic dish with.
a mandolin or shop knife this mandolin cut on a long way like this to see that.
Pat it just kinda kinda can go as long as you want and basically as long as the.
zucchini doesn't have a lot of heavy seeds you can sort of like use this as.
noodles.
ok yeah so now here's what we're going to do we're going to take some olive oil.
that's when you use the knob you don't use your knob high medium medium-low you.
gotta use your knob now that ladies keep it G back there please.
we have a guest alright so now what we're going to do is we want to flavor.
the soil but you see the pins not speaking hot right now right.
it's not all hot because i used the knob but what we want to do is before this.
gets hot we want to flavor see garlic burns people make a big mistake that.
turns the skillet on they get it on high.
it's like ready to jump off the stove it so high they add the garlic it's burned.
into seconds and then they wonder why everything tastes bitter so what we do.
is we start and when you start hearing it just kind of sizzle like that like.
it's doing now you can flavor the oil even better i was telling you earlier.
about certain spices ingredients right crushed red pepper see we're going to.
get the flavor right out of that a little bit of green onion all ya Babel.
scallion you would call right see we're getting a flip we're not cooking them.
all out now what we're gonna do is we're gonna start layering our noodles of.
zucchini and then what we're going to do is we're just gonna sort of whiteley.
doesn't look good.
wait always it does smell good.
that's why I'm telling people at home we gotta get smell-o-vision you know get.
with the program you don't have smell-o-vision I call your cable company.
complaint look a little salt little pepper now here's what we do something.
very very white a little remove we just add a little bit of that just for just.
for flavors.
Josh flavor.
ok.
and what I do now is I just take a little just a little ragout like this of.
tomato and we're just going to let it sort of trap in there and sort of steam.
and keep all the nice healthy stuff in there and when we come back I'll show.
you what it looks like stick around don't touch that guy we'll be right back.
we can take show.
30.
feels absolutely job while I'm doing this is to get really hungry a and.
starving be opened my eyes it gets a little jazz debris there we could enjoy.
it and see.
put on some kind of great music which is either paparazzi or do we pretty much.
something like that that makes a good.
this is a really simple dish is just basically and a chicken dish that has.
white wine garlic kalamata olives and fresh basil and a little bit i basically.
make this would dark meat because it stays much more tender and because we.
have were limited to how we can prepare it its it's kind of a braised dish night.
from seeds falling a little bit long perfect enemy tiny major pasta and just.
keeping it warm and then just kind of put it together really even their total.
food easy everything we do is around it out her soul long we've been after.
two-and-a-half weeks you just you can't eat any more food that's not home cooks.
you get crazy it's show good simple food it's just so get ready happy that's our.
married this one all things can fade with cooking never die could have the.
minutes till your next great meal on the best.
yeah.
yeah.
news around the bandwidth and the missions in the house Pat Benatar.
alright this thing is getting so white about fading away here a little bit of.
tomato remember i told you earlier about those fresh herbs a little cherryville.
parsley chives and a little basil as much as you like now I'm just going to.
fold this in you just want the herbs to just just for a minute just get that.
flavor out and then basically will serve the zucchini pasta dish here it does.
look good huh.
it's like to and uh basically what you could always do to enhance it a little.
bit you could always just do a little essence like this around.
damn like that just just a kind of you know what I can't take it being so late.
just a little.
just a little goes a long way.
all right when we come back killed Rondo pat benatar and I another stick around.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah.
ok.
right around.
yeah CD is called go like go get it.
talking about a little flavor pops these roma tomatoes that you can buy year.
round cut them in half season with salt and pepper covering with olive oil and.
you slow roast them in the oven and they really can do wonderful things for pasta.
pizza salads maybe 50 minutes to an hour 300 degrees get the juices going.
alright so now i gotta put you on the spot well then help me cook.
yeah right come on Pat Benatar.
yeah.
foreground thanks but I got pine nuts and on you don't have to chop them too.
much but I was gonna do this phyllo you and I do this little layer I know feel.
well that's as you it's hard to work with feeling but look we got this guy.
here in New York it's not that regular phyllo stuff this guy but we're gonna.
win we're in it together i trust that what i thought what we would do is we'd.
make a little Peter and so if you could just put a rough chop on that and then.
we'll bring one layer out on the cutting board of the phyllo and you could brush.
it with olive oil and then we could sprinkle a bit of the pine nuts on that.
that would be great and feel free whenever you want to kick it up you know.
just go ahead just go ahead and now i got this today down at the the old.
market i saw this funny-looking spinach isn't some funny looking spinach.
I mean I first looked at it I went mmm daddy wine but I tasted it was really.
really delicious but of course I don't really want to walk to use too much of.
the steps that so what I'm going to do is I'm just got the oven on low or the.
stove on low i should say and i'm going to just sort of take this spinach.
oh that's good that's perfect like that apple and . now what we'll do is I'm.
going to start wilting that can see I have discovered here Pat because when.
people work with feeldoe if they don't dumb they don't cover it with a damp.
towel it gets all brittle and that's some of the big problems that people.
have so I'm gonna do a little layer of that for you right there and then you.
want to add a little bit of moisture to this and so that's where the olive oil.
comes in so if you want to just lightly brush it and then a little pine nuts.
like that maybe we could do like three layers of that while I'm over here on.
spinach detail i know all these but I i thought it would be worth this intense.
flavor of the spinach with this disorder of organic spinach it tasted really good.
so hopefully it'll end up tasting good.
alright so the stems you could save for.
I don't know maybe you're raising some snails in the backyard or something I.
don't.
so now that i have that and i have my heat on very very low that I'm.
wilderness we could do one of two things we could add butter but we're keeping it.
light are we could add a little olive oil that would be really good and dog.
are you making out over the time good it looks like you don't look so all right.
I'm coming to help you little sprinkle another layer so folks what you want to.
do is try to get about three layers of this because what we're going to do is.
instead of using pizza dough we're going to use this phyllo dough like this you.
can see it doesn't have to be quite exact little salt then also what I did.
but that's just because of me.
I i actually have my monkey.
so I actually have like a little one.
so how about if we do this a little olive oil so light and a little h2o and.
we're just gonna kind of work this down a little bit now are you ready for me.
already.
wow that chicken dish looks fantastic not funny.
did I don't doc I use the doctor I don't have to keep at it keeps it more tender.
alright so the reason for our madness patent I hear what we're doing is we're.
gonna we got three layers now we got this little ball like this and what.
we'll do is we'll just go around path and sort of make a circle like we're.
making a pizza around and we'll keep it keep it as close as we can okay and ..
meanwhile what I'm going to do here now is our take this wilted spinach you.
don't have to cook it that much.
yeah yeah cooking with Pat Bennett going with me that's great.
well done.
so I'm just gonna shock this spinach you don't have to cook it very long turn the.
heat off and what do I mean by that well see I'm i got a little ice bath here and.
when you do that you shocked it real good but also what happens it's.
vulnerable right now so just like took it even more water and spinach has a lot.
of water so what you want to do is after it shocked you don't know ice we're.
going to squeeze out make sure it's good and Cole are you doing great so now this.
is what happens when we put those on the on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan and.
we're going to bake them off for about 12 minutes at about 350 degrees and you.
don't have to worry about doing that that's the great thing about having an.
awesome see now Pat what we do is we got that spinach like that this is what the.
philos look like when they come out of the oven.
see they got a little poofy like that just a little bit so now what we're.
going to do is we're going to use this as sort of some white pizza okay that's.
going to be like well you'll see roasted garlic you can trust that on the bus huh.
no Evan we're gonna have to get some connection a connection next time we're.
going to get some connection some are you know you're gonna cook for Neil and.
I'll just FedEx your care package and then haha and forget the oven you know.
ok so here we go pack now that we've got this is what we're going to do we're.
going to take on you have that brush.
yep to brush it one more time on the top perfect and then what we'll do is now.
will add a little bit of spinach like this that we blanched ok stems little.
bit of spinach like that got you want to do another and then is the reason for.
the lightness that pattern i right now we're doing very light very light.
practically down Fifth Avenue right now we're going to add a couple of cloves of.
this roasted garlic on the spinach like this okay and then pat and i are going.
to put them in the oven for about doesn't take that long maybe about six.
minutes when it comes out we're going to flavor it with a little bit of oregano.
and some feta cheese for our light pizza.
alright that's when we come back okay stick around we'll be right back pat.
benatar everybody.
yeah.
yeah.
hey welcome back everybody feels wrong on the band.
one of the greatest chefs on the planet Pat Benatar ladies and gentlemen.
you know those seven Tomatoes that we are that we did so we put a few of those.
on but let me let me show you what we did during the commercial break and then.
we're going to get into a sort of a little lighter style gumbo that i'm.
going to show you how to do so look at this we got these sort of pizza things.
going on so now what we do Pat little oregano then we do a little crush pine.
nut like that you had earlier.
yeah really nice and then instead of using the other will use this feta.
cheese because it's good light i'm not making this stuff up.
come on work with me so little feta cheese like that and then just to sort.
of finish it.
what we do patterns this will just kinda take a little bit more olive oil.
whoo alright for me since we got it light.
I'm just gonna hit it with a little pepper.
alright now we're going to put this back in the outback alright so this goes in.
the oven and we got a little white pizza now like the hottest thing to make light.
is like gumbo is Gumbo's gumbo so here's a trick that I wanted to show you.
whether you want to keep it light or not.
first of all we're going to keep it shellfish fish shellfish light you know.
how we always take when you make the room because the the whole secret with.
gumbo is all in the room so we take equal parts of vegetable oil.
I would use butter but vegetable oil right light and then instead of adding.
that what we've done to sort of get more flavor out of it is we are ahead of time.
we've toasted the flower you can do this this is done a lot in Louisiana to speed.
up the process of those doc through Gumbo's but you need an oven.
yes and so you can do that now it doesn't take it takes like a good hour.
hour-and-a-half to do this but it's speeds it up and you get all this.
wonderful flavor all ready to start now too much flour you add a little bit of.
oil like this until we get that but look at the color already packed.
well it's about 350 degrees and um you know room shouldn't be so thick thick.
thick it should be spreadable like that but look at all ready to call the folks.
on that ok.
I mean where they're ready just from toasted in the oven right now we can.
start with the Trinity so we've got onion and we've got celery and we've got.
bell pepper now we got to let this cook one thing with the vegetables.
all a little bit of salt do you mean that Cayenne right there Pat police salt.
and we're going to use cayenne pepper spice it up now one of the things about.
the vegetables here gotta let them cook 8 to 10 minutes get the flavor out after.
eight to ten minutes what we're going to do is we're going to add both 30 cloves.
of garlic.
hey it's help.
I had a couple of bay leaves and a little bit of time so what we're going.
to do is we've got fish stock and we've got clam juice after the garlic we're.
going to add okra that I cut fresh okra ok tomatoes and then what I'm going to.
do is I'm just going to use pieces of gumbo crabs like this inside for that.
flavor.
ok but guess what guess what I got away eight to ten minutes so i got asked you.
think you could like to sing a song for us walk.
yeah Pat Benatar.
ok.
yeah.
you.
continue.
yes.
yeah.
yeah.
striking.
when we.
watch this.
will.
yeah.
yeah.
No.
yeah i got high.
yeah.
you out like i said earlier go like go get it.
yeah speaking about that listen to this that gumbo once you add the oakley add.
the tomatoes then you put the crabs and the crabs gonna give it all this nice.
flavor but it's also delicious that takes about 45 minutes to an hour that's.
where i'm at right here in a nice little similar smell i love me love it now if.
you want to kick it up a notch lighter like we're gonna do now when it does.
that we're going to add the shrimp we're gonna add some crabmeat we're going to.
add some oysters and some green onions and a little bit of possibly and then.
look we don't have to cook this very long we're just gonna get that love.
thing going in there.
taste it season it speaking about what we made.
watch how beautiful these are oh yeah you thought we forgot about him huh.
no way talk about a great little snack.
look at how light these are there practically floating to you so you just.
have it that and what I like to do is you can just sort of drizzle it can cut.
it with a little pizza wheel if you want drizzle with a little olive oil and.
that's that.
sorry PAC I I gotta get a little-a little hot.
not.
yeah i was saved as weak safe home by now you gotta serve gumbo with rice my.
opinion sassafras on the side.
hot sauce on the side it's just one of those things you gotta do remember the.
Seafood has like a built-in thermometer you don't have to.
once you add the shrimp and it starts cooking you don't have to cook it much.
longer you serve a little bit of that like gumbo like that then see how nice.
that color is because of that flower that we toasted little bit of rice.
little green onions and hopefully you all got a healthier choice tonight right.
folks all right.
I want to thank the guys in the band footprint of course neil giraldo want to.
thank him.
ladies and gentlemen Benatar.
are you
