Here lives [Toni Pepperonibot](https://www.facebook.com/tonipepperonibot)'s brain. Please ignore it. It is really dumb.

I'm so sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

## Make Pepperonibot smarter!

If you actually care (why do you care?), all of the corpora that pepperonibot is trained on lives within `dat` and ends
in `.data`. `model.json` is built using these files. If you have a corpus you want to contribute, do the following:

1. Sanitize the corpus. Delete all weirdness and make sure sentences end with a period.
2. Add the original url of the corpus to `CREDITS`.
3. Submit a PR lol.
