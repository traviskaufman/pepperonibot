 I'm emeril lagasse chef and owner of Emeril's and Nola restaurants in New.
 Orleans and you know food is my life I love to cook I love to eat love wine.

 best recipes but meet some of the most interesting people who have created them.
 in this show it's about my friends some restaurant owners some award-winning.
 chefs and some that have written exceptional cookbooks.
 so let's get started because today we're going to feature a corn and black bean.
 and red pepper salad that's right for my friends Melanie bond odd and Brooke do.
 janae's parties.
 that's right a book on parties and first from my great friend and Cincinnati a.
 red bell pepper fettuccine with lobster from mortgage restaurant that's right.
 and my great friend mr. richard perry that's right richard perry you know.
 orchids restaurant is located in the Army Netherland Plaza in cincinnati ohio.
 and richard perry did not train for the restaurant business look at that is the.
 picture of the interior of orchids a beautiful beautiful restaurant he didn't.
 train there's my good friend mr. richard perry a true gentleman in a great chef.
 and he didn't train under the apprenticeship program typical of this.
 industry but he is nevertheless a gifted cook a talented talented chef a good.
 friend his extensive travels allowed him to sample many different regional and.
 national cuisines and he absorbs some of their influences and he has carried his.
 penchant for American cuisine with him he is a big believer of the land's it's.
 a blend of homespun and familiar taste with complex and sophisticated.
 ingredients and techniques and just a delightful delightful guy we've been a.
 friend a long time and a great inspiration to the mid.
 west and its cuisine and here's the ingredients you need for Mr Perry's red.
 bell pepper with fettuccine and lobster you need minced shallots and white wine.
 lemon juice white pepper fish stock and heavy cream and red bell pepper.
 fettuccine lobster meat and green onions very simple ingredients.
 hey don't get nervous on me folks if you didn't have a chance to write those down.
 you know at the end of the show i'm going to tell you how to get the recipes.
 now I have a tip for you about shallots and i don't mean green onions or.
 scallions shallots the classic this is a shallot here and when you are buying.
 shallots you want to make sure that the their firm there in the onion family you.
 sort of treat him like an onion as well by peeling off the ends and then the.
 skin you can see that this is used for a lot of cooking particular classical.
 cooking like French cooking in European cooking the shallot but treated just.
 like an onion as i said because if you cut it in half and then if you can just.
 cut it as I've said many times about a regular onion then you have the diced.
 onion just like that i'm going to show you again cut those and then we want to.
 come in and then cut down and uh you know I believe that shallots you.
 shouldn't grind them and I small up in a food processor you want to do my hand so.
 that way you get the flavor of the shallot and not the watery and it it's.
 much better to do by hand you get much more flavor from the shallot and.
 speaking about flavors you know you go through the grocery store today and.
 they've got just about every flavor of posture imaginable also shapes and sizes.
 and one of the dishes from my friend richard perry that we're going to be.
 doing a red bell pepper pasta.
 this is a fettuccine that's has it's green it's been flavored with spinach.
 and here is an angel hair that's been flavored with some tomato now how do.
 they do this how do they flavor these pastas well the posture is made into a.
 simple pasta dough and then what happens is the extraction of either spinach or.
 tomato or cayenne pepper or squidding noodles those black noodles that i'll.
 show you in a second.
 that's kind of reduce down into a concentrate and then that's folded.
 inside of the pasta dough a regular egg pasta dough and gives it that great.
 flavors a matter of fact recently I even discovered some chocolate pasta that's.
 right some chocolate pasta.
 here's the squid ink noodles which the squinting of calamari or from squid they.
 use that is a very popular one and then as a tomato and basil you can see the.
 specs on this particular pasta and beat postures and vegetarian and fresh herbs.
 and all sorts saffron pasta but is that extract extraction that's worked into.
 the dough.
 ok red bell pepper fettuccine with lobster for my good friend richard perry.
 at his restaurant orchids what Richard does is a lot a lot of shallots look at.
 how many shallots there and he does this extraction of shallots lots of white.
 wine and he uses some stock or clam juice or lobster stock or perhaps what.
 you can use as a neutral stock if you can't do that even a good shrimp stock.
 will do and he reduces this on the stove slowly he brings this to a boil and then.
 he brings this simmering roughly for maybe about 20 to 30 minutes on a slow.
 simmer what that's doing is evaporating that moisture and concentrating those.
 flavors and then what you have is this reduction here it looks like this.
 he cooks it more than halfway and it tastes.
 mm absolutely delicious extracted all the flavor from the shallots and now.
 what Richard does is he adds a little bit of white pepper and some lemon juice.
 to that mixture mysterious stories that up and reduces that and he says you can.
 use this base for a lot of wonderful sources for fish and for shellfish by.
 just taking it and beginning to work with this now what we're going to do is.
 we're going to take some green onions or some scallions we're going to saute them.
 just a tiny bit of olive oil and then we're going to add some heavy cream tiny.
 bit of heavy cream and then some pieces of ice lobster meat we're going to add.
 and then we don't want this to boil we just want this too lightly simmer i'm.
 going to show you there's not a lot of lot of sauce in there now what we're.
 going to do is we're going to take our red pepper fettuccine and in some.
 lightly salted water we're going to begin to start cooking that and that's.
 gonna cook just roughly about two to three minutes depending on the doneness.
 that you like I prefer to the tooth that's right or al dente.
 now what Richard wants to do is take a little bit of this wine and shallot.
 extraction add a little bit of that to that mixture and see what we have right.
 here and stir that in now you see it's not as stick and it has ms wonderful.
 delicious flavor and once the pasta has been cooked as you can see here we're.
 going to add some of that red pepper fettuccine black bean and corn and this.
 is cilantro one of my favorite favorite herbs and I want to take some cilantro.
 and shop that just like as soon as you cut the cilantro it immediately let.
 so off this delicious flavor and we're going to add that and then we're going.
 to toss those garnishes in with our delicious salad as you can see and then.
 what we're going to do is we're going to simply just add some of our salad you.
 could use this even as a relish perhaps with some grilled fish of grilled.
 chicken doesn't have to be just served the by itself and then you can see that.
 we have a wonderful salad and I'm going to take the end of this green onion and.
 so will make a little flower like such and add that and you have a wonderful.
 wonderful corn black beans and red pepper salad used for a lot of things as.
 a salad as an accoutrement for perhaps some fish or chicken and don't worry if.
