I want you to find this Nancy boy Elliot Ness and I want him dead, I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground! I wanna go out in the middle o’ the night and piss on his ashes!
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.
I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse.
I don’t wanna be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.
You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend.
Now go home and get your fucking shine box.
You don’t make up for you sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it.
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.
You can get much further with a kind word and a gun than you can with just a kind word.
A guy told me one time… don’t let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.
If you want me to keep my mouth shut, it's gonna cost you some dough. I figure a thousand bucks is reasonable, so I want two.
Now if I ever, I mean if I ever, see you here again you die, just like that.
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
When they send for you, you go in alive, you come out dead, and it's your best friend that does it.
You Don the Jeweler? That's a beauty, eh? That's some beautiful thing.
Give it to your wife.
How'm I gonna give it to my wife? I ain't married.
You got a girlfriend?
Yeah. Louise.
Marry her.
Are you for real? I'm asking if you want to middle a diamond here. All I want for my end's eight thousand.
I'm saying give it to somebody don't know any better. It's a fugazy.
How can you say it's a fugazy? You looked at it two seconds.
Go ahead, try and sell it, you wanna be a dunsky.
I'm a dunsky? Let me tell you something, my friend--do you know who you're talking to?
Here, Left, have a spritzer.
My family, my children--my mother can hold her head up in any neighborhood in the city when she walks down the Clock. In all the Five Boroughs I'm known, fuggedaboudit--I'm known all over the world. You ask around--ask anybody about Lefty from Mulberry Street.
Look at me. I did this to you. Remember me.
From now on, nothing goes down unless I'm involved. No blackjack no dope deals, no nothing. A nickel bag gets sold in the park, I want in. You guys got fat while everybody starved on the street. Now it's my turn.
You know somethin’, Mikey. You make me laugh, you know that? I borrow money all over this neighbourhood left and right, from everybody, and I never paid ‘em back....I Borrow money from you because you’re the only jerk off around here that I could borrow money from without payin’ back, right? ‘Cause that’s what you are, That’s what I think of you, a jerk off.
You don’t understand. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I could’ve been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.
Get this through your head you mutharfucka you! You only exist out here because of me... You’re fucking warned! Don’t ever go over my fucking head again, you mutherfucker you!
Made it, ma! Top of the world!
I know you know where they are, so tell me. Before I do some damage you won’t walk away from.
You see this knife? I'm gonna teach you to speak English with this fuckin knife!
You mean, let me understand this cause, ya know maybe it's me, I'm a little fucked up maybe, but I'm funny how, I mean funny like I'm a clown, I amuse you? I make you laugh, I'm here to fuckin amuse you? What do you mean funny, funny how? How am I funny?
Yeah he had a foolproof scheme all right. It wasn’t very scientific, but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fck themselves. What were they gonna do, muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle.
Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown.
Then make more fucking money, this is America. You don’t make money, you’re a fucking douche bag.
I never fucked anybody over in my life didn’t have it coming to them. You got that? All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don’t break ‘em for no one. Do you understand?
Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy, or are you gonna bite?
You know, I've often thought that the gangster and the artist are the same in the eyes of the masses. They are admired and hero-worshipped, but there is always present underlying wish to see them destroyed at the peak of their glory.
I ain't so tough.
If you’re good at something, never do it for free.
All right, you proved your point. You broke into my vault. Congratulations, you’re a dead man.
I’m not mad, I’m proud o’ you. You took your first pinch like a man and you learned the two greatest things in life... never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut.
Every once in a while, I’d have to take a beating. But by then, I didn’t care. The way I saw it, everyone takes a beating sometime.
Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, the c*nts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up.
There was this kid I grew up with... he had an idea to build a city out of a desert stop-over for GI's on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man, a man of vision and guts. And there isn't even a plaque, or a signpost or a statue of him in that town! Someone put a bullet through his eye. No one knows who gave the order. When I heard it, I wasn't angry; I knew Moe, I knew he was head-strong, talking loud, saying stupid things. So when he turned up dead, I let it go. And I said to myself, this is the business we've chosen; I didn't ask who gave the order, because it had nothing to do with business!
So say goodnight to the bad guy!
King Kong ain't got shit on me!
Let me tell you something. There's no nobility in poverty. I've been a poor man, and I've been a rich man. And I choose rich every fcking time.
The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting. That's pride fcking with you.
But then, like a flash, it came to me. And I realized, fck man, maybe that's what hell is: the entire rest of eternity spent in fckin' Bruges.
Mook? I'm a mook? Yeah. What's a mook? A mook, what's a mook?
You still don't see, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small-time Charlie!
